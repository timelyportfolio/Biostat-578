What is Bioinformatics?
=======================
- It depends who you ask but, according to [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org): 


> Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops and improves on methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data.

- Also according to [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org): 

> Bioinformatics uses many areas of computer science, mathematics and engineering to process biological data. 

- **What about statistics?** Statistics plays an important role in Bioinformatics. You can't analyze data without statistics.

- **Bioinformatics is an art** that involves biology, statistics, mathematics, programming, and discipline (e.g. reproducibility).



---
Outline
=======
The syllabus is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/) at [https://github.com/raphg/Biostat-578](https://github.com/raphg/Biostat-578)

- All lecture notes, R code, etc, are (will) also be available there.

    - Lecture notes are written in R markdown and processed using knitr, and thus are **fully reproducible** including R code and examples. The notes are fully versioned via git (and [GitHub](https://github.com/)). 

    - You will learn more about these tools later. 
    
- You are more than welcome to modify, correct and/or contribute. Very easy to do via **pull requests**. Please do not send me correction via emails. 

- **Grading scheme (Tentative)** HW: 40%, Midterm: 30%, Final project: 30%



---
Reproducible research
=====================
Throughout this course, I will emphasize the use of open source tools for reproducible  research. You might want to read the following article:

Huang, Y., & Gottardo, R. (2012). Comparability and reproducibility of biomedical data. *Briefings in bioinformatics*. doi:10.1093/bib/bbs078

I expect each one of you to become familiar with:

- [R](r-project.org) and [RStudio](r-project.org)

- [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/). An R package to provide dynamic report generation with R. 

- [git](http://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/). RStudio provides an integrated client for git. 

We will make heavy use of these tools throughout the course. 


---
Some R history
========================================================
- R is the son of S
- S is a statistical programming language developed by John Chambers from Bell Labs
- Goal of S was "to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully"
- S was created in 1976
- New S language arrived in 1988 (Blue Book) and introduced many changes (macros to functions)
- Version 4 was introduced in 1998 and introduced a formal class-method model
- In 1993, StatSci (maker of S-Plus) acquire exclusive license to S
- S-Plus integrates S with a nice GUI interface and full customer support
- R was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand


---
R
===- The R project started in 1991
- R first appeared in 1996 as an open-source software!
- **Highly customizable via packages**
- R based community, power of collaboration with thousands of packages freely available
- Many of my favorite R capabilities are not part of the base distribution
- Many graphical user interface to R both free and commercial (e.g. R studio and Revolution)


---
What is R?
==========R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes:
- an effective data handling and storage facility
- a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices
- a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis
- graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
- well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

---
R basics
========R is an overgrown calculator!
```{r some-easy-math}
2+2
exp(-2)
pi
sin(2*pi)
```


---
Getting help
============You can easily find help via the command line:

```{r getting-help}
help(pi) # equivalent ?pi
?sqrt
?sin
?Special
```

If you don't know the exact name, use
```{r getting-more-help}
help.search("trigonometry")
??trigonometry
```
Or using the help tab integrated in RStudio, or using your favorite search engine!


---
Assignment
==========
Need a way to store intermediate results:
```{r storing-things}
x <- 2
y <- 2
x+y
```

Try to use meaningful names! 
Have a look at:
- [Hadley Wickham's book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
- [Google's coding standards](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml)



---
Vectorized arithmetic
========================================================We cannot do much statistics with a single number!

We need a way to store a sequence/list of numbers

One can simply concatenate elements with the `c` function.

```{r concatenate}
weight <- c(60, 72, 75, 90, 95, 72)
weight[1]
height <- c(1.75, 1.80, 1.65, 1.90, 1.74, 1.91)
bmi <- weight/height^2 # vector based operation
bmi
```
- Vector based operation are much faster!
- `c` can be used to concatenate strings and numbers.

**Exercise:** Find at least one other way to create a vector.


---
Data structures
========================================================
Even vectors can be limited and we need richer structures.

**Homogeneous:**
- Vectors (1-d)
- Matrix (2-d)
- Arrays (n-d)

Can be logical, integer, double (often called numeric), or character

**Heterogeneous:**
- List
- Dataframes

For more details: [http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html)


---
Vectors
=======
We have three types of vectors: numeric, logical, character
```{r vectors}
# Numeric vectors
x <- c(1, 5, 8)
x
# Logical vectors
x <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
x
# Character vectors
x <- c("Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Francis")
x
```

**Exercise:** Create a vector with the following elements 1, 3, 10, -1, call your vector x. Take the square root of x. Take the log of (1+x).


---
Missing and special values
==========================We have already encountered the `NaN` symbol meaning not-a-number, and `Inf`, `-Inf`. In practical data analysis a data point is frequently unavailable. In R, missing values are denoted by `NA`. 

Depending on the context, R provides different ways to deal with missing values.

```{r missing-values}
weight <- c(60, 72, 75, 90, NA, 72)
mean(weight)
mean(weight, na.rm=TRUE)
```



---
Matrices and arrays
===================
A matrix is a two dimensional array of numbers. Matrices can be used to perform statistical operations (linear algebra). However, they can also be used to hold tables. 

```{r matrices}
x <- 1:12
length(x)
dim(x)
dim(x) <- c(3, 4)
x
x <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, byrow=TRUE)
x <- matrix(1:12, nrow=3, byrow=FALSE)
rownames(x) <- c("A", "B", "C")
colnames(x) <- c("1", "2", "x", "y")
```


---
Matrices and Arrays (suite)
===================
Matrices can also be formed by "glueing" rows and columns using `cbind` and `rbind`. This is the equivalent of `c` for vectors.

```{r matrices2}
x1 <- 1:4
x2 <- 5:8
y1 <- c(3, 9)
my_matrix <- rbind(x1, x2)
new_matrix <- cbind(my_matrix, y1)
new_matrix
```

n-dimesional arrays generalize matrices, as follows:
```{r arrays, eval=FALSE}
array(1:9, c(3, 3, 3))
```


---
Factors
=======
It is common to have categorical data in statistical data analysis (e.g. Male/Female). In R such variables are referred to as factors. Makes it possible to assign meaningful names to categories. A factor has a set of levels.

```{r factors}
pain <- c(0, 3, 2, 2, 1)
fpain <- factor(pain)
levels(fpain) <- c("none", "mild", "medium", "severe")
is.factor(fpain)
is.vector(fpain)
# Additional attribute
levels(fpain)
```
A factor is very similar to an integer vector with a set of labels. While factors look like character vectors, they are not. So be careful when converting factors to characters and vice-versa. For example, use `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when reading dataframes (more on this later).


---
Lists
=====Lists can be used to store objects (of possibly different kinds/sizes) into a larger composite object. 
```{r lists}
x <- c(31, 32, 40)
y <- factor(c("F", "M", "M", "F"))
# Different types and dimensions!
z <- c("London", "School")
my_list <- list(age=x, sex=y, meta=z)
my_list
my_list$age
```


---
Data Frames
==========A data frame is a "data matrix" or a "data set". It is a list of vectors and/or factors of the same length that are related "across" such that data in the same position come from the same experimental unit (subject, gene, etc).
```{r data-frames}
my_df <- data.frame(age=c(31, 32, 40, 50), sex=c("M", "M", "F", "M"))
my_df$age
```
Why do we need data frames if it is simply a list? 
- More efficient storage, and indexing!

Dataframes are similar to database tables.
R provides some (more efficient) alternatives to dataframe. More later!


---
Names
==========Name(s) of an R object can be accessed and/or modified with the `names` function (method).

```{r names}
x <- rep(1:3)
names(x)
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")
my_df <- data.frame(age=c(31,32,40,50), sex=y)
my_df
names(my_df)
names(my_df) <- c("age", "gender")
names(my_df)[1] <- c("Age")
```

Names are a special kind of attributes. See more here: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html#attributes



---
Indexing
========
Indexing is a great way to directly 
access elements of interest.

```{r indexing}
# Indexing a vector
pain <- c(0, 3, 2, 2, 1)
pain[1]
pain[2]
pain[1:2]
pain[c(1, 3)]
pain[-5]
```
Note that with a data frame, the indexing of subject is straightforward!


---
Indexing (suite)
================
```{r indexing-suite}
# Indexing a matrix
my_matrix[1, 1]
my_matrix[1, ]
my_matrix[, 1]
my_matrix[, -2]
# Indexing list is done in the same way
my_list[3]
my_list[[3]]
my_list[[3]][1]
# Indexing a data frame
my_df[1, ]
my_df[2, ]
```




---
Indexing by name
================
```{r indexing-by-name}
my_list$age
my_list["age"]
my_list[["age"]]
my_df["Age"]
# Try also
# my_df[1]
# my_df[[1]]
```

What is the main difference between `[[]]` and `[]`?


---
Conditional indexing
====================Indexing can be conditional on another variable!

```{r conditional-indexing}
pain <- c(0, 3, 2, 2, 1)
sex <- factor(c("M", "M", "F", "F", "M"))
age <- c(45, 51, 45, 32, 90)
pain[sex=="M"]
pain[age>32]
```

**Exercise:** Do the same by indexing with F.
Do the same with age less than 80.


---
Functions and arguments
=======================
Many things in R are done using function calls, commands that look like an application of a mathematical function of one or several variables, e.g. `log(x)`, `plot(weight,height)`

We will see more on this when explore advance graphics in R.

Most function arguments have sensible default and can thus be omitted, e.g. `plot(weight, height, col=1)`

**Note:** If you do not specify the names of the argument, the order is important!


---
Loops and conditional statements
================================
R is a true programming language, and thus has a rich syntax including `for` loops and conditional statements (`while`, `if`, `ifelse`, etc).

```{r if-statement}
# A simple if statement
x <- -2
if(x>0) {
  print(x)
} else {
  print(-x)
}

if(x>0) {
  print(x)
} else if(x==0) {
  print(0)
} else {
  print(-x)
}
```

--------------

```{r for-while}
# For loops
n <- 1000000
x <- rnorm(n, 10, 1)
y <- x^2
y <- rep(0, n)
for(i in 1:n) {
  y[i]<-sqrt(x[i])
}

y[1:10]

# While loops
counter <- 1
while(counter<=n) {
  y[counter] <- sqrt(x[counter])
  counter <- counter+1
}

y[1:10]
```


---
Functions and arguments (suite)
===============================
You can easily create your own function in R. Recommended when you plan to use the same code over and over again.

```{r NR}
# Newton-Raphson to find the square root of a number
MySqrt <- function(y) {
  x <- y/2
  while (abs(x*x-y) > 1e-10) {
    x <- (x+y/x)/2
    }
  x
  }
MySqrt(81)
MySqrt(101)
```



---
Vectorized operation
====================For loops are notoriously slow in R, and whenever possible, it is preferable to use vectorized operations. Most functions in R are already vectorized.

```{r vectorized-ops}
# Let's generate some uniform [0,10] random numbers
n <- 10000
x  <-  runif(n, 0, 10)
y <- rep(0, n)

library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(for(i in 1:n) y[i] <- sqrt(x[i]), sqrt(x), times=10)
```

The for loop is increadibly slower! 

While you will often hear that R is slow, there are many ways to speed up calculations in R, often by using third party libraries (e.g. data.table, Rcpp). 


---
The *apply family
===========================================The `*apply` family of functions is intended to try to solve some of the side effects of `for` loops, such as facilitating it's application to R objects (e.g. lists) and improving efficiency. 


The most common `*apply` functions are 
- `apply`:  Returns a vector or array or list of values obtained by applying a function to margins of an array or matrix.

- `lapply`: apply a function or each element of a list or vector

- `sapply`: a user-friendly version and wrapper of lapply by default returning a vector, matrix or, an array. sapply will try to guess what the output should be based on the input.

For more details have a look at [this](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-use-the-apply-family-of-functions-in-r.html).


---
Vectorized operation with the *apply family (suite)
===================================================
```{r vectorized-apply}
# Let's generate some uniform [0,10] random numbers
n <- 10000
x  <-  runif(n, 0, 10)
y  <- rep(0, n)
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(for(i in 1:n) y[i] <- MySqrt(x[i]), sapply(x, MySqrt), times=10)
```

`*apply` functions are not necessarily faster than `for` loops, but they can be very convenient and usually lead to more compact and more elegant code. 

More efficiency gain can be obtained using compiled code (e.g. C++). R provides multiple ways to call compiled code. In particular, the [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html) package can greatly facilitate the use of C++ compiled code.

**Exercise:** Write some code to use the `apply` function on a given matrix.


---
Reproducibility and literrate programming
=====================- Approach to programming introduced by Donald Knuth
    - An explanation of a program logic in a plain English, interspersed with chunk of computer code.
- Sweave
    - Create dynamic reports by embedding R code in latex documents
    

---
knitr vs. Sweave
==================
- Sweave is good but ...
    - Writing latex is painful
    - Output is limited to pdf
- knitr
    - Transparent engine for dynamic report generation
    - knitr allows any input languages (e.g. R, Python and Awk) and any output markup languages
    

---
knitr: a feature rich package
=============================- Full control of input, code, and output
    - Fine control over how the code is executed and the ouput is displayed
    - knitr can process input files in various formats: latex, html, R markdown
- [R markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown.html)
    - markdown:  easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that can be converted to html
    - R markdown: markdown + R code chunks
- [R presentation](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/presentations/overview)
- knitr is readily accessible in RStudio


---
Markdown
========Markdown is a simple markup language similar to wiki markups

![Markdown in RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/images/docs/markdownOverview.png)


---
R Markdown
==========Mardown with R code chuncks.

![R Mardown](http://www.rstudio.com/images/docs/markdownUntitled.png)

As we've seen, R expressions can also be evaluated inline:

pi=`r pi`


---
knitr and caching
=================
Large data and complex analysis can require significant computing time
    
- Not unusual for an analysis to take a few minutes to an hour, or even more!
- This can result in some performance issues when viewing a report → User frustration
- Why rerun a script when nothing has changed?
- The solution is caching


---
knitr and caching (suite)
=================
knitr provides powerful caching mechanism:

- cache can be turned on/off for each code chunk
- If caching is on, knitr will check if the code has changed when rerunning a report
- Chunks can be made dependent
- The caching mechanism is flexible can be attached to an R version, an input dataset, a date, etc.
